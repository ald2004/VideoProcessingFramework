# VideoProcessingFramework

VPF stands for Video Processing Framework. Itâ€™s set of C++ libraries and Python bindings which provides full HW acceleration for video processing tasks such as decoding, encoding, transcoding and GPU-accelerated color space and pixel format conversions.

VPF also supports exporting GPU memory objects such as decoded video frames to PyTorch tensors without Host to Device copies.
